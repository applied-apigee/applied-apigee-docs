## Discovery

The Apigee Customer Success team run a workshop with Miren and Yuriy to understand how APIs, Apps, Analytics and a Cloud Strategy can transform their
business.

It took two packs of post-its, but the team identify a minimum viable business 
outcome that can be implemented and tested to prove the value of the program.

They predict their local newspaper headline for the following year:

> *Local Pizza shop wins award AGAIN after serving their 1000th Order!*

In order to reach this goal, they identify the following business concerns:

- Our kitchen is too small
- We need more ingredients
- One delivery driver isn't enough

The team quickly realises that if they fixed all of these problems tomorrow,
their current ordering process couldn't scale to utilise the new resources.

By creating an Pizza Orders API, they get the following benefits:

- Enables a mobile app for Delivery Drivers
- Enables order tracking by connecting to a screen in the kitchen
- Allows third party fast food websites to connect to their restaurant
- Analytics can be recorded to help efficiently order ingredients
- Staff shift patterns can be optimised
