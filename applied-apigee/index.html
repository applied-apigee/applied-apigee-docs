        <p>Miren and Yuriy own a Pizza Shop.</p>
<p>Currently, orders are placed by telephone and recorded on paper.</p>
<p>Once cooked by Yuriy, pizzas are delivered by Miren one order at a time.</p>
<p>Miren and Yuriy recently won the prestigous ‘Pizza of the Year&#39; award. They are expecting 10x demand.</p>
<p>They have hired Developer Dane to help with their Digital Transformation. Dane would like to use Apigee and Google Cloud Platform.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Discovery" duration="0">
        <p>The Apigee Customer Success team run a workshop with Alice, Bob and Carol to understand how APIs, Apps, Analytics and a Cloud Strategy can transform their business.</p>
<p>It took two packs of post-its, but the team identify a minimum viable business outcome that can be implemented and tested to prove the value of the program.</p>
<p>They predict their local newspaper headline for the following year:</p>
<p><em>Local Pizza shop wins award AGAIN after serving their 1000th Order!</em></p>
<p>In order to reach this goal, they identify the following business concerns:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our kitchen is too small</li>
<li>We need more ingredients</li>
<li>One delivery driver isn&#39;t enough</li>
</ul>
<p>The team quickly realises that if they fixed all of these problems tomorrow, their current ordering process couldn&#39;t scale to utilize the new resources.</p>
<p>By creating an Pizza Orders API, they get the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enables a mobile app for Delivery Drivers</li>
<li>Enables order tracking by connecting to a screen in the kitchen</li>
<li>Allows third party fast food websites to connect to their restaurant</li>
<li>Analytics can be recorded to help efficiently order ingredients</li>
<li>Staff shift patterns can be optimized</li>
</ul>

      <google-codelab-step label="Solution Design" duration="0">
        <p>A Technical Solutions Consultant from the Apigee Customer Success team works with Developer Dane to create a High Level Solution Design and initial scope.</p>
<pre><code>+-------------+    +-----------+    +-------------+
| Kitchen App |    | Order App |    | Drivers App |
+-------------+    +-----------+    +-------------+
         |               |                |
+--------------------------------------------------+
|                  API Platform                    |
+--------------------------------------------------+
         |                                |
+------------------+               +---------------+
| Identity Service |               | Order Service |
+------------------+               +---------------+

</code></pre>
<p>At this stage, the team do not worry about specific details of this design, but instead look for something they can rapidly prototype and test with real customers.</p>
<p>They also discuss that the APIs built here can be reused for third-parties.</p>
<p>However, they do identify the need to integration with the following components in order to follow best practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developer Portal for third-party onboarding and documentation</li>
<li>Message Logging to help with customer support</li>
<li>Monitoring to identify issues in production</li>
<li>Source Control system for storing coding</li>
<li>Continuous Integration system to manage the test and deploy pipeline</li>
<li>An Open ID Connect Compliant Identity Provider</li>
</ul>
