## Problem Statement

Miren and Yuriy own a Pizza Shop. 

Currently, orders are placed by telephone and recorded on paper.

Once cooked by Yuriy, pizzas are delivered by Miren one order at a time.

Miren and Yuriy recently won the prestigous 'Pizza of the Year' award. They are 
expecting 10x demand.

They have hired Developer Dane to help with their Digital Transformation. Dane 
would like to use Apigee and Google Cloud Platform.
